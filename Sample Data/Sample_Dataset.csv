The wonderful song and the message of that friend really empowered and encouraged me and made me feel unforgettable(unforgetable). And since then, whenever I feel a little sad, I listen to this song and allow myself to feel better. In the last few months, I decided to approach some of the people closest to me and share the song with them. Those to whom I dedicated the song and the message, like my 15-year-old son and my wife, were very, very excited.", https://youtu.be/MKCyUe4syc4?si=19_26WU665LGsUpL
2,20,user2@gmail.com,User20,"Anyone who has children can't help but tremble at the song ""Shir Mishmar"" (Keep your soul) by Alterman Vargov. A few days ago my 8 year old daughter turned to me and told me that she was insulted in class. I hugged, encouraged and strengthened her and told her she was not alone. I wish I could protect her at any moment, but of course that is impossible and I know that reality will bring her together with difficult situations. When you become a father, worry becomes an integral part of life. Especially today, when dangers lurk around every corner. Sometimes I feel powerless that all I can actually do is only warn of dangers, but not prevent them. I know that my daughter will have to experience some of the dangers herself and survive them. All I can do is just tell her ""take care"" and hope it will be alright.", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNIgtKeKfc
3,30,user3@gmail.com,User30,"This song helps me see how people around us are a fascinating and inspiring story and how unique and special each one is. If we only want to, we can reveal the beautiful and valuable sides in us, our desire and potential for connection and dialogue. If we do this we can see to what extent each of us has the visible face and the hidden face. And these last ones are fascinating, valuable and give a lot of room for optimism.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZgNYoZkeU
4,40,user4@gmail.com,User40,"There are so many dimensions in this song ""Beyond the Rainbow"" - immense optimism, hope, the daring to dream, the wonderful melody, the moving words... What is certain is that every time I hear it something in the world seems to stop and my heart expands. song that also embodies the wonderful movie ""The Wizard of Oz"" which has so many wonderful insights. For example, the Tin Man, the Scarecrow and the Lion who are unaware that they lack nothing and are great just the way they are, but! You have to go through a great journey to recognize this. I have also been through such journeys and will certainly continue to go through more. There are no shortcuts in the journey of believing in ourselves!", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSZxmZmBfnU

I immediately thought to myself, how beautiful and how important the reminder I received that love is always the solution. In a song by the Bee Gees""How Deep is Your Love""they singWe live in a world of fools who try to break us instead of letting us be who we are. This song is a wonderful love song that the lovers do not give up. And so are we - we will never give up on love.", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpqqjU7u5Yc
